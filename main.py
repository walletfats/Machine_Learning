#This is a place for me to begin trying to understand neural networks and deep learning.. 
#This will be done through the use of youtube/google/stack overflow -- self taught

# TODO
# Pytorch or tensorflow
# Learning Support Vector Machines 
# Linear Regression review 
# KNN algorithm
# Applying all of these fundementals in code and understanding them well
# Implement a neural network
